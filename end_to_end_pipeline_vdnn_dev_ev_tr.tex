\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amssymb} %new add for \triangleq

\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Video annotation as a means to gather training data-set is proven to be beneficial in the progress of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Recently, front-ends to achieve easy and efficient DNN prototyping has gained much attention in the deep learning domain. A system where one can load DNN models under development, study or evaluation and apply them directly on the video to learn model accuracy is not readily available. Such close integration of annotation, training, model development and evaluation is the best way to rapidly prototype a deep learning application. With this paper, we discuss a system implementing the end-to-end pipeline which help achieve faster prototyping and research. The system inherently support Darknet with YOLO (the system allows easy integration with other models under development). 
The easy to use front-end provide the interface to load user supplied configuration and weights files along with triggers to run the model on videos or image-lists captured particularly to generate data-sets for further training, research or prototyping.

\section{Introduction}
An interactive video annotation tool where one can easily annotate objects, train their model, learn the progress metric and work on rapid prototyping is the holy grail of model development and research. This paper presents a system which enable such pipelined supervised training. The system keeps track of the progress metric in terms of object prediction accuracy, bounding box precision and undetected objects that are manually added. This progress metric helps the researcher to easily track weak spots and improve on the learning algorithm. The comprehensive evaluation module deals with automatic progress evaluation with easy to understand representation of pitfalls, accuracy measures and errors on a per object, per frame basis throughout the video. \par
The system discussed in this paper is developed as part of a research project aimed at creating an ecosystem that supports easy prototyping and study of deep learning technology and neural network models. \par
Furthermore, the system discussed in this paper supports labelling and learning an infinite number of objects.  

\section{System Overview}\label{sec.overview}

\subsection{Motivation}

\subsection{System Architecture}
The system presented in this paper implements the core functionality in a server module. The server module will be a web application which could be hosted on a CUDA enabled server, like the NVIDIA DGX.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\figwidthb]{fig/system_architecture.pdf}
\caption{System Architecture.} \label{fig.structure}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Server}
There shall be a web server hosted with the video/image-set database. The server implements basic video annotation features like user-account, video annotation data and label management. There can be administrator users and staff users. Administrator will be able to add/delete users, add/delete video annotation jobs, add/delete classification labels for annotaion. Staff users will be able to view the video annotation jobs and annotate appropriately the objects identified under the list of provided labels.
\subsubsection{Model interface (MI)}
The model-interface defines an extensive API, bridging the communication between the Server and deep-learning neural network models under research.
\subsubsection{A deep neural network model (DNN)}
A deep learning neural network model like the convolutional (CNN) YOLO model which was used to implement the system discussed in this paper.
\subsubsection{Metric analysis engine (MAE)}
The metric analysis engine appropriately calculate the progress-metric as discussed in the workflow section below.
\subsubsection{Client interface (CI)}
The client interface is managed by the web server.
\subsubsection{Browser}
The client browser shall render the user interfaces for:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Manual video annotation and corrections
	\item DNN model configuration
	\item DNN model run
	\item View comprehensive evaluation
\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow}
\subsection{Data Inference Level}
The tool runs the model with saved configurations on the input video and saves the generated annotation data-set in the database. This enables the researcher to visually see the error and correct any of them. The tool in the background calculates:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the error for each annotation made (at box level).
	\item un-detected objects which the user was able to detect.
	\item And the such.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training}
The user can then train the model again with the new data-set. 

\subsection{Loop continues}
The user can now re-iterate the process with another data-inference cycle, pre-processing data and triggering the data-set generation. MAE shall learn the changes with new data-set against the old, backup the accurate manually corrected data and provides the user with the improvement metric and areas at fault. MAE uses video overlays to depict the metric at a frame level over the source video data.

\section{Progress Metric}
The Progress Metric shall be a simple visualisation of inference accuracy as detected by MAE. The metric shall consider:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bounding box precision.
	\item Object prediction accuracy (boolean; whether the object was classified correctly).
	\item Object detection status (boolean; whether the object was detected by the model or was manually labelled after inference).
	\item Object tracking accuracy (if applicable; boolean; whether the object was tracked between adjacent frames).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bounding box precision}
We use IoU (Intersection over Union) to measure the bounding box precision. The IoU value is in-turn used to map object bounding boxes between the ground truth and model prediction.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\figwidthb]{fig/iou_equation.png}
\caption{IoU equation.} \label{fig.structure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Accuracy counts}
The accuracy counts calculated for each class/label for the comprehensive evaluation result are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item True Positives. 
	\begin{displaymath}
	\mathbf{t}_p
	\end{displaymath}
	This is the number of bounding boxes classified correctly according to the labels used to train the model. Say, when an object, car is correctly classified as a car.
	\item False Positives
	\begin{displaymath}
	\mathbf{f}_p
	\end{displaymath}
	This is the number of bounding boxes classified in-correctly according to the labels used to train the model. Say, when an object, car is incorrectly classified as a truck.
	\item True Negatives
	\begin{displaymath}
	\mathbf{t}_n
	\end{displaymath}
	This is the number of bounding boxes classified correctly as objects the model was not trained for. Say, when an object airplane whose classification is not desired is left unpredicted.
	\item False Negatives
	\begin{displaymath}
	\mathbf{f}_n
	\end{displaymath}
	This is the number of bounding boxes classified in-correctly as valid objects. Say, when an object airplane whose classification is not desired is classified as a car.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Precision}
	Precision is the percentage of true positives in the classified objects' list. Thus, precision is a metric associated with a single class.
	\begin{align}
	\mathbf{precision}=\mathbf{t}_p / (\mathbf{t}_p + \mathbf{f}_p) = \mathbf{t}_p / {n}
	\end{align}
	where $\mathbf{n}$ is the total number of objects classified by the model.
\subsection{Recall}
	Recall is the percentage of objects correctly classified. Thus, recall is a metric associated with a single class.
	\begin{align}
	\mathbf{precision}=\mathbf{t}_p / (\mathbf{t}_p + \mathbf{f}_n)
	\end{align}
\subsection{Precision Recall Graph for each class}
	Rule of thumb is that a good model shall maintain high precision and high recall with different threshold values used for the classification score/probability. Thus a precision-recall graph plotted between the precision and recall values of a class across the frame or video for different subsets of predicted output, give us a pretty good visualisation of the model quality. The subset used here is sampled from the list of classified bounding boxes, sorted with the model's score value. The subset shall move from as low as one object to all the objects in the list. Popular evaluation models like the one used with VOC Challenge uses a 11-point sampling, but we propose the more accurate k-point sampling, where we plot precision-recall values for every subset that results a change in the accuracy count metric.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\figwidthb]{fig/pr_rcnn.png}
\caption{Prediction recall curve when we ran RCNN for a 2 second video.} \label{fig.structure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Average Precision for each class}
	Average precision is the single number derived from the above graph, simply by taking the area under the plotted curve.
	$${AP} = \int_{0}^{1} P(r) dr$$
	Practically the area under the curve could be implemented as:
	$${AP} = \sum_{k=1}^{N} P(k) {\Delta}r(k)$$
\subsection{Interpolated Average Precision for each class}
	Interpolated average precision is calculated the same way as we calculated {AP} above, but, instead of using {P(k)}, the maximum precision value: 
	$${max}_{k\textsuperscript{'}>= k} {P(k\textsuperscript{'})}$$
	Thus:
	$${IAP} = \sum_{k=1}^{N} {max}_{k\textsuperscript{'}>= k} {P(k\textsuperscript{'})} {\Delta}r(k)$$

\subsection{Mean Average Precision across all the classes the model was trained on}
	Mean average precision, {mAP} is the mean of the {AP} values calculated for each of the classes supported by the model. 
	
%Math symbol: $\hat{r}_{n,m}^{(k)}$.

%Equations:
%\begin{align}
%\mathbf{f}_t^n=\mathbf{R}_b^n \mathbf{f}_t^b + \mathbf{e}^n
%\end{align}
%where $\mathbf{e}^n$ is the error of the force that applied to the smartphone. The figure is shown in \figref{fig.doublefigure} and \figref{fig.structure}.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec.related}
The need for having an end-to-end pipeline for DNN modelling and training has been tackled by the project named DIGITS. NVIDIA provides DIGITS under the BSD license, available at http://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS. The essential difference between DIGITS and the system proposed in this paper is the fact that our system attempts to closely integrate data-set generation techniques like video annotation and modelling together. This substantially mitigate the ordeal involved with training and modelling of deep neural networks.

There are some projects discussing the process of automatically annotating videos using deep learning like \cite{baptist2016automatedendtoend}, with a focus on multimedia archive search-ability.
